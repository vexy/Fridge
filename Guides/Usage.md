# üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Fridge Usage Guide
In short, following guide describes **how to**:
  - [fetch data from network](#network-fetching)
  - [load/store an object](#data-handling)
  - [handle errors](#error-handling)
  

For more information, you can always check provided, `in-code` documentation.

## Network fetching  
With Fridge, network fetching is performed in just 3 steps:
1. Make sure your desired `struct` conforms to `Decodable`
2. Define `URL` endpoint where your model resides
2. Await for Fridge to `grabüîÆ(...)` the object

Example code: 
```Swift
// Step 1 - conforming to Decodable
struct MyStuff: Decodable {
    var something: String
    var elixirOfL‚ù§Ô∏èfe: URL
    var piTimesE: Float

    init(privateüîë: muhash(0x61F612d)) {
        //do fatalError if elixir cannot be initialized (!)
    } 
}


// Step 2 - defining fancy URL endpoint
let fancy_URL = URL(string: "https://fancy.url.stuff")!  //be nice and unpack this before serious usage


// Step 3 - Grab it with Fridge !
let _stuff: MyStuff = try await Fridge.grabüîÆ(from: that_fancyURL)
print("Elixir of live is: \(_stuff.elixirOfL‚ù§Ô∏èfe)")

```

Yup, and you're all **set**. `Fridge` will perform the network fetch, decode network data and return your `struct` as you wished. Easy peasy right ?

**IMPORTANT:**  
Fridge may encounter several types of errors along the way. Make sure to check error handling section for more details.  

## Data handling
Similar to fetching, data storing and retreiving is done in few simple steps:
1. Define desired `struct` and conform it to `Encodable`
2. Define unique `identifier` to mark your struct
3. Use Fridge to either `freezeüßä(...)` or `unfreeze` the object
  
### üßä Freezing an object
```Swift
// Step 1 - Conforming to Encodable
struct StoringStuff: Encodable {
    var _id: UUID
    enum Stages {
        case Opened
        case Closed
    }
}
let storeObject = StoringStuff()

// Step 2 - Define unique identifier
let storeIdentifier = "store.identifier"


// Step 3 - Freeze it with Fridge !
try Fridge.freezeüßä(storeObject, storeIdentifier)
```

### Unfreezing an object
If your object is already frozen before, you can revert it back easily, in just few steps:
1. prepare your `struct` by conforming to `Decodable`
2. define unique `identifier`
3. Use Fridge to `unfreeze` the object
```Swift
// Step 1 - Preparing struct with Decodable
struct StoringStuff: Decodable {
    let category: String
    let isRealExample: Bool
}

// Step 2 - Define unique identifier
let objectID = "object.xyz"

// Step 3 - Unfreeze it with Fridge (assuming it was frozen before)
let retrievedObject = try Fridge.unfreeze(objectID)
```

**IMPORTANT:**  
If your store identifier cannot be found `Fridge` will throw an Error. Check the section below for more information on error handling.

## ‚õîÔ∏è Error Handling
Each of the Fridge method, is internally marked with `throws` keyword. Here's what you can deal with:
