# Fridge ‚ùÑÔ∏è0.7.1
**Fridge** is the silliest refrigerator you'll ever use on a dialy basis.  
With Fridge, your fancy `struct`(s) will raise and shine, allowing you to focus on your plan to conquer Earth...finally !

#### Waaaait... a refrigerator ü§î There has to be a trick !
That's right! `Fridge` is actually one super fancy computer program, and if you talk with it gently, it can do magic for you !

Say, you want to store your data into persistant storage. Easy !  
Just conform your fancy `struct` into `Codable` first:
```Swift
struct Myüßûtruct: Codable {
    var something: String
    var elixirOfL‚ù§Ô∏èfe: URL

    //fatalError if elixir cannot be initialized (!)
    init() { ... }  
}

let crucialObject = Myüßû‚Äçtruct(privateüîë: 0xb375af2.hash())
//..okay, I'm ready. Now what? ü§®
```
Then, as you would do with let's say pizza, just:

```Swift
//freeze it into refrigerator
Fridge.freezeüßä(crucialObject)
```

And you're done !

### üòÆ really? What else can Fridge do
Inside `Fridge` there are handy of prepacked stuff:
  - `freeze` method to persistantly store your `struct`s to disk
  - `unfreeze` method to directly load your `struct` back from the storage
  - `grab(from:)` or `grab(using:)` method to get your `struct` directly from the network
  - then you can...

### Stop. Have you said network calls ?!!? üò≤
Well yeah. Prepare your `URL` or `URLRequest` object first:
```Swift
let thisURL = URL(string: "https://my.secret.plan/api/v433x/users")
//or if you need better control over URL request then:
let customRequest = URLRequest(..someMagic...)
```
Then, call `grab(from:)` or `grab(using:)` to get it from the network like so:
```Swift
let networkObject = Fridge.grab(from: thisURL)
//or this one, depending on your needs
let anotherOne = Fridge.grab(using: customRequest)
```
*... MORE TO COME ...*

## Okay. How can I install Fridge
Using `Swift Package Manager` is by far the sexiest way to install silly `Fridge`.  
Just add following line to your `Package.swift`:  
`dependency: ["this_repo_i_guess_"]`
