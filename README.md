# üí† Library interface
`Fridge` is a freezing device ‚ùÑÔ∏è. It has to keep things cool enough, exposing following icy interface.

### Async/Await networking
  - `Fridge.grabüîÆ(from: URL)` -> Grabs your model from the network endpoint (_iOS 15+ only_)
  - `Fridge.pushüì°(object, to)` -> Pushes (sends) your model to designated network endpoint (_iOS 15+ only_)
  
Fridge is supported by `async/await` and is here to reduce the pain of:
  - fetching _your stuff_ from the network,
  - parsing or decoding (JSON) data,
  - doing boring _error checking_
  - and yeah... good old **closures**.

With Fridge, you can even _say goodbye to closures and CoreData_ if you want!    

### Persistant storage
  - `Fridge.freezeüßä(object, identifier)` -> Safely "freezes" your `struct` to persistant store
  - `Fridge.unfreezeü™Öüéâ(identifier)` -> "Unfreezes" (previously frozen), `struct` giving you control of it
  -  `Fridge.isFrozenüî¨(identifier)` -> Quickly check if your `Fridge` have been loaded with certain `struct`

Fridge storage mechanics are built on Foundation principles and use `BSON` as internal storage mechanism. All you have to do is to conform your struct to `Encodable` and you're ready to go, Fridge will take care of the rest.  
Checkout internal documentation for more information.  

# Code examples
> _Talking is cheap. Show me the code._ - Linus Torvalds

```Swift
// Make your fancy struct conform to Decodable
struct GHRepo: Decodable {
    var name: String
    var repositoryURL: URL
}

// Call grabüîÆ method...
let myRepo: GHRepo = try await Fridge.grabüîÆ(from: URL("https://github.com/vexy/")!)

// Then, at your will
print(myRepo)
print(myRepo.name)
```

# Documentation
> _RTFM isn't a joke..._ ü•¥ 
    
In the **[Docs](Guides/Usage.md)** you'll quickly figure out how to:
  - *easily fetch object* from the network,
  - *persistently store* your objects,
  - *load them back* into your app,
  - *catch nasty errors* along the way
  - all other dirtly little secrets about the Fridge
  
Check [usage examples](Guides/Examples) or entire [Guides](Guides/) collection for more goodies.  
`Xcode Playground` file can be found [here](Guides/Examples/Fridge-basics).
For a bigger picture overview, feel free to check [architecture](Guides/Fridge.diagram.md) diagrams... ‚à∞      

# Installation
Using `Swift Package Manager` is by far the sexiest way to install `Fridge`.  
Update both `dependencies` and `targets` section in your `Package.swift`, to look something like this:  

```Swift
// swift-tools-version:5.3
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YOUR-PACKAGE",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/vexy/Fridge.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.8.7"))
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "YOUR-TARGET", dependencies: ["Fridge"])
    ]
)
```
  
Quick links:
```
name: "Fridge"
url: "https://github.com/vexy/Fridge.git"
branch: "main"
```

## Minimum versions required
For `Fridge` to work in full capacity, following Swift & iOS configuration is _recommended_:
  - Xcode `13.1+`
  - Swift `5.5`
  - iOS `15.0+`
  - macOS `12.0`
  
Recommended versions mentioned above area guaranteed to successfully build & test `Fridge` ‚úÖ.  
If nothing else, you can always fire an [issue](https://github.com/vexy/Fridge/issues) if you stumble upon the way.
  
Although, you can even run `Fridge` with following: üòÆ 
  - iOS `11.0+`
  - macOS `10.14`
  
...but **you won't** be able to `grabüîÆ` things nor any of the fancy `async/await` things. Sorry ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

*NOTEs*  
Be sure to meet minimum configuration parameters as you may encounter difficult-to-recover build errors on earlier configurations.  
_Sometimes_, setting liker flag to `-Xfrontend -enable-experimental-concurrency` helps, but may fail if building with commandline.  
That may be helpfull for `Xcode 12.x`, assuming `Swift 5.x` is installed.  

Checkout official [Swift.org](https://www.swift.org/) website, for supporting earlier than minimums and other info.

# Contribution guidelines
If you like Fridge, feel free to fire a [pull request](https://github.com/vexy/Fridge/pulls).
The prefered way is to branch off the `main` branch, complete feature or a fix and then merge to `development`. After the pull request has been approved, your change will be merged to `main`.  

Don't be affraid to start any [discussions](https://github.com/vexy/Fridge/discussions) if you think so.  
[Issues](https://github.com/vexy/Fridge/issues) section is a good way to start, if you stumble upon the way.
