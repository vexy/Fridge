# üí† Library interface
`Fridge` is a freezing device. It has to keep things cool enough, exposing this icy interface for us:
  - `Fridge.grabüîÆ(from: URL)` - Allows you to easily "grab" your model from the network endpoint
  - `Fridge.freezeüßä(object, identifier)` - to (persistently) "freeze" your `struct` for future use
  - `Fridge.unfreeze(identifier)` - to load your `struct` back and take control of it
  
`Fridge` is built using `async/await` philosophy and is here to reduce the pain of _fetching your stuff from the network_, parsing, _storing and retreiving stuff_, doing endless _error checking_ and yeah... good old **closures**. You can even say goodbay to closures and CoreData if you want!  
`Fridge` is built on Foundation principles and uses _BSON_ as internal storage mechanism. 
It is **lightweight**, with extremely narrow interface, with small - Foundation based - `Error` type system.

### _"Talking is cheap. Show me the code. - Linus Torvalds"_

```Swift
// there's a catch here !
struct GHRepo {
    var name: String
    var repositoryURL: URL
}

let someRepo: GHRepo = try await Fridge.grabüîÆ(from: URL("https://github.com/vexy/")!)
print(someRepo)

// ..and that's it ! (khm)
```  

### _"RTFM isn't a joke. So..."_ 
Oh yeah, `Fridge` can ofer way way more, _but it's alllll in the [Docs](Guides/Usage.md)_ ü•¥   
Aside from discovering how to remove that _shocking build error_ from the üëÜ code example,in the **Docs** you'll quickly figure out how to:
  - *persistently store* your objects,
  - *load them back* into your app,
  - *catch nasty errors* along the way
  -  (**COMMING SOON**) _fine grain_ fetch or store process
  - dirtly little secrets about the Fridge

# How to install ?
Using `Swift Package Manager` is by far the sexiest way to install silly `Fridge`.  
Update both `dependencies` and `targets` section in your `Package.swift`, something like this.
```Swift
// swift-tools-version:5.5
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YOUR-PACKAGE",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/vexy/Fridge.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.8.2"))
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "YOUR-TARGET", dependencies: ["Fridge"])
    ]
)
```

# Minimum versions required
`Fridge` requires following Swift & iOS configuration:
  - Swift `5.5`
  - iOS `15.0`
  - macOS `12.0`

*NOTE*  
Be sure to meet minimum configuration parameters as you may encounter difficult-to-recover build errors on earlier configurations.   
_Sometimes_, altering liker flag `-Xfrontend -enable-experimental-concurrency` helps, but may fail if building with commandline  
Checkout official Swift.org website, for supporting earlier than minimums and other info.

# External dependencies
Fridge uses [BSON](https://github.com/mongodb/swift-bson) external library, licenced under MIT Licence.  
Check original README for more instructions.
