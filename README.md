## Features
- Easy declaration of file/image/object to be downloaded
- Painless asynchronous object download on background threads
- Assign `onComplete` and `onFailure` closures to perform your custom work after download
  - or you can just ignore this and access your object directly after it has been downloaded üëç
- Customizable destination of download objects
  - you can always use default system provided `Cache` folder


## Instalation guide
### Manual install

*TLDR* ; drop all `Fridge` source files in your project and you're good to go !!

There is no need to clone entire repo. Entire Fridge logic is packed into 4 files you need to use.
Navigate to `Fridge` folder, select and add following files to your project :
- `Fridge.swift`
- `FridgeItem.swift`
- `FridgeErrors.swift`
- `ItemFileManager.swift`

There's additional `main.swift` file that has primarily been used for testing. Will be removed soon, so **don't rely** on that.   
Alast, you can see the basic usage examples there as well üôÉ

Having installation [issues](https://github.com/vexy/Fridge/issues) ?   Just let me know !

```Swift

var item = FridgeItem()
item.url = URL(string: "http://www.google.com")!

//#2: declare action (closures) that will be performed after download  (psst.. things will work just fine even if you don't do this !! üòú)
item.onComplete = { object in
    print("üí™ Download complete ! File is permanently stored at : \(object.absoluteString)")
}
item.onFailure = { error in
    print("üëé Unable to complete download ! Following error occured \(error.localizedDescription)")
}

// optionally set you download object destination path
item.downloadDestination = URL(string: "/some/folder/that/iwant/")!

//#3: create your Fridge
let myFridge = Fridge.shared

//...and kick-off your download !!
myFridge.download(item: item)
```

### #2 Fetch an image from internet
```Swift
//#1: declare FridgeItem that holds an image you want to download 
var someImage = FridgeItem("http://www.bigfoto.com/airplane.jpg")

//#2: access your image after it has been downloaded
item.onComplete = { imageURL in
    print("üí™ Download complete ! My image file is now stored at : \(imageURL.absoluteString)")

    //create UIImage :
    let actualImage : UIImage = UIImage(contentsOfFile: imageURL.absoluteString)!

    //..then do something with this image, eg :
    let anImageView : UIImageView = UIImageView(actualImage!)
}
item.onFailure = { error in
    print("üëé Unable to download this image ! Following error occured \(error.localizedDescription)")
