# Fridge ‚ùÑÔ∏è0.8.2
**Fridge** is perhaps the silliest `Swift5 async/await` network implementation you'll ever see.  
With Fridge, your fancy `struct`(s) will raise and shine, allowing you to focus on your plan to conquer the Earth...finally !

## Usage
So say you *just wanna grab that model from the network* and do your stuff. **Your** stuff...  

Well, first conform your fancy `struct` into `Decodable` like this:
```Swift
struct MyStuff: Decodable {
    var something: String
    var elixirOfL‚ù§Ô∏èfe: URL
    var piTimesE: Float

    init(privateüîë: muhash(0x61F612d)) {
        //do fatalError if elixir cannot be initialized (!)
    } 
}
```

Then, you can go ahead and *just grab* it from that fancy `URL` of yours..

```Swift
let _stuff: MyStuff = try await Fridge.grabüîÆ(from: fancyURL_of_mine)
print("Elixir of live is: \(_stuff.elixirOfL‚ù§Ô∏èfe)")
```

Yup, and you're all **set**. `Fridge` will perform the network fetch and decode the network data and return your `struct`.  
Easy peasy right ?

### Minimum Swift & iOS versions
`Fridge` requires following configuration:
  - Swift 5.5
  - iOS `15.0`
  - macOS `12.0`
  
`Fridge` is built using `async/await` philosophy and is here to reduce the pain of fetching your stuff from the network, parsing, doing endless error checking and yeah... good old closures.  
You can even say goodbay to closures if you want. 

*NOTE*  
Be sure to meet minimum configuration parameters as you may encounter difficult-to-recover build errors.  
_Sometimes_, altering liker flag `-Xfrontend -enable-experimental-concurrency` helps, but may fail if building with commandline  
Checkout official Swift.org website, for supporting earlier than minimums and other info. 

### Library interface
`Fridge` has very simple interface to work with:
  - `Fridge.grabüîÆ(from: URL)` method to get your `struct` directly from the network
  - `Fridge.freezeüßä()` to store your `struct` on the disk

## How can I install Fridge ?
Using `Swift Package Manager` is by far the sexiest way to install silly `Fridge`.  
Just add following line to your `Package.swift`:
```
Package: "Fridge",  
URL: https://github.com/vexy/Fridge.git
```
