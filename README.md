# üí† Library interface
`Fridge` is a freezing device ‚ùÑÔ∏è. It **has** to keep things cool enough, exposing just icy interface.

### Networking
|Method|Description|
|-|-|
`Fridge.grabüîÆ(from: URL)`|Grabs your model from the network endpoint (_iOS 15+ only_)|
|`Fridge.pushüì°(object, to)`|Pushes (sends) your model to designated network endpoint (_iOS 15+ only_)|
  
Fridge networking model supports `async/await` philosophy and is here to reduce the pain of:
  - fetching _your stuff_ from the network,
  - parsing or decoding (JSON) data,
  - doing boring _error checking_
  - and yeah... good old **closures**.

With Fridge, you can even _say goodbye to closures and CoreData_ if you want! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Checkout [documentation](Guides/Usage.md) for more information.    

### Persistant (local) storage
|Method|Description|
|-|-|
`Fridge.freezeüßä(object, identifier)`|Safely "freezes" your `struct` to persistant store|
|`Fridge.unfreezeü™Öüéâ(identifier)`|"Unfreezes" (previously frozen), `struct` giving you control of it|

Fridge storage mechanics are built on Foundation principles and use `BSON` as internal storage mechanism. All you have to do is to conform your struct to `Encodable` and you're ready to go, Fridge will take care of the rest.  
  
Checkout [documentation](Guides/Usage.md) for more information.  

# Quick code example
```Swift
// 1. Conform your fancy struct to Decodable
struct GHRepo: Decodable {
    var name: String
    var repositoryURL: URL
    // ... other fields
}

do {
  // 2. Await for grabüîÆ method...
  let myRepo: GHRepo = try await Fridge.grabüîÆ(from: URL("https://github.com/vexy/")!)
} catch let err {
  print("Naaah.. Something bad happened: \(err)")
}

// 3. Then, at your will, use myRepo as any other Foundation object
print(myRepo)
print(myRepo.name)

// ... something ...

// 4. Later on...
do {
  try Fridge.freezeüßä(myRepo, id: "myIdentifier")
} catch let e {
  print("Whoops... Here: \(e)")
}
```

Here is some **real world** usage of `Fridge`:  
  - [**Clmn** - _Beautiful macOS app that operates with tasks in columns_](https://github.com/igr/Clmn)
  - [Playground examples of Fridge practical usage](/Guides/Examples/Fridge%20basics.playground/Contents.swift)

# Installation instructions
Using `Swift Package Manager` is by far the sexiest way to install `Fridge`.

```Swift
// swift-tools-version:5.3
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YOUR-PACKAGE",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/vexy/Fridge.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.9"))
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "YOUR-TARGET", dependencies: ["Fridge"])
    ]
)
```
  
Quick links:
```
name: "Fridge"
url: "https://github.com/vexy/Fridge.git"
branch: "main"
```

## Minimum versions required
For `Fridge` to work in full capacity, following Swift & iOS configuration is _recommended_:
  - Xcode `13.1+`
  - Swift `5.5`
  - iOS `15.0+`
  - macOS `12.0`
  
Recommended versions mentioned above area guaranteed to successfully build & test `Fridge` ‚úÖ.  
If nothing else, you can always fire an [issue](https://github.com/vexy/Fridge/issues) if you stumble upon the way.
  
Although, you can even run `Fridge` with following: üòÆ 
  - iOS `11.0+`
  - macOS `10.14`
  
...but **you won't** be able to `grabüîÆ` things nor any of the fancy `async/await` things. Sorry ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

*NOTEs*  
Be sure to meet minimum configuration parameters as you may encounter difficult-to-recover build errors on earlier configurations.  
_Sometimes_, setting liker flag to `-Xfrontend -enable-experimental-concurrency` helps, but may fail if building with commandline.  
That may be helpfull for `Xcode 12.x`, assuming `Swift 5.x` is installed.  

Checkout official [Swift.org](https://www.swift.org/) website, for supporting earlier than minimums and other info.

## External dependencies
Fridge uses [BSONCoder v0.9](https://github.com/vexy/bsoncoder) - Copyright by [Vexy](https://github.com/vexy).

# Documentation
> _RTFM isn't a joke..._ ü•¥ 
    
In the **[Docs](Guides/Usage.md)** you'll quickly figure out how to:
  - *easily fetch object* from the network,
  - *persistently store* your objects,
  - *load them back* into your app,
  - *catch nasty errors* along the way
  - all other dirtly little secrets about the Fridge
